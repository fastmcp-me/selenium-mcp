# Contributing to Selenium MCP Server

First off, thank you for considering contributing to the Selenium MCP Server! It's people like you that make this project great. Your help is appreciated, and every contribution is valuable.

## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests, or writing code which can be incorporated into the main project.

### Reporting Bugs

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/pshivapr/selenium-mcp/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/pshivapr/selenium-mcp/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Open a new issue to discuss your enhancement. Clearly describe the proposed enhancement and its use case.
- Before submitting a pull request, it's best to discuss the proposed change in an issue to ensure it aligns with the project's goals.

### Pull Requests

- Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
- If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
- Ensure the test suite passes.
- Make sure your code lints.
- Issue that pull request!
